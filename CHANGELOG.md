# Changelog

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-26

### Changed

#### Error Handling Strategy

- **BREAKING**: Clarified error handling approach - the SDK now consistently follows a two-tier error handling strategy:
  - **Validation errors** (missing/invalid input data) are thrown as exceptions immediately before API calls
  - **API response errors** (business logic, not found, etc.) are returned as unsuccessful Response objects
- Updated documentation to clearly explain when exceptions are thrown vs. when to check `response.success?`

#### Test Infrastructure

- **BREAKING**: Standardized all test specifications to use connection doubles instead of Faraday-specific mocks
- Updated test pattern across all resource specs to use `instance_double("PaystackSdk::Connection")` for better framework independence
- All tests now follow consistent mocking pattern with `PaystackSdk::Response.new()` expectations

#### Documentation

- Enhanced README with comprehensive error handling examples
- Added validation error examples showing `MissingParamError`, `InvalidFormatError`, and `InvalidValueError`
- Updated Quick Start guide to demonstrate proper exception handling
- Clarified the difference between input validation (exceptions) and API response handling (Response objects)

### Improved

- Better separation of concerns between input validation and API error handling
- More consistent test suite that's not tied to specific HTTP client implementation
- Clearer developer experience with predictable error handling patterns

## [0.0.7] - 2025-06-25

### Added

- Transfer Recipients resource with full CRUD operations (create, list, fetch, update, delete)
- Transfers resource with full API support (create/initiate, list, fetch, finalize, verify)
- All resource methods now use `handle_response` for consistent response handling
- Regression tests for Transfer Recipients and Transfers resources, ensuring response wrapping and validation

### Changed

- Registered `transfer_recipients` and `transfers` resources in the main client for easy access
- Updated specs to verify that all resource methods wrap responses using `PaystackSdk::Response`

### Improved

- Enhanced test coverage for new resources and response handling

## [0.0.6] - 2025-06-10

### Added

- Customers resource with full CRUD operations (create, list, fetch, update)
- Customer validation and risk action management features
- Customer authorization deactivation functionality
- Comprehensive documentation for Customers API in README

### Changed

- Improved test consistency by standardizing response body format using string keys with hashrocket notation (`=>`) across all test specifications
- Enhanced error handling specificity in tests by using appropriate error classes (`InvalidValueError`, `InvalidFormatError`, `MissingParamError`) instead of generic `Error` class

### Improved

- Better test coverage and reliability with consistent response format handling
- More precise error validation ensuring proper exception types are raised for different validation failures
- Enhanced documentation with comprehensive examples for all customer operations

## [0.0.5] - 2025-05-15
